Why git logs so small ?? 

Implment report from deanonumuzation?
Example -> What was deanonuymized

./formatFilterAndViz-nofo-GraphML.py -l test-data/TensorFlow/jpim-2024/chromium/tensorFlowGitLog-all-till-12-Apri-2024.NetworkFile-filtered-transformed-to-nofo.graphML -ns centrality-score -v
Works fine.
Just legend should be more to the right

Radical approach to make it working with simple

node lists and label list

nodelist TOP10 --- ALLNOTINTOP10  expand
labellist the same this will simplify


if -nc gray-color-to-unknown-firms and top10+other 

we must have a square for others in gray


Make business-firm-color-dictionary-json github project as a public project

Make it work for top10 legend type
Make then wortk for top 10+ others as default. All not in top 10 gend diff color.
Implement logging 

 ./formatAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py -pl test-data/5-pentagon-with-star.graphML


* Implement ll argument outside 'outside_center_right'
Mart other options as not implmented
* Mark down that node coloring and what node sizing strategies are not implemented
* Mark the legend types that are not implemented

The testcase 3 needs to be more sofisticated

Create documentation folder 
Document formatAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py add link to README.MD
Document formatAndViz-nofo-GraphML.py add link to README.MD
Document transform-nofi-2-nofo-GraphML.py add link to README.MD

Increase size of labels

# ScrapLogGit2Net - formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py

## Documentation of the tool formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py for visualizing the network of individual software developers

**formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py** is a shell executable Python script for visualizing GraphML files created with the ScrapLogGit2Net tool for modeling inter-individual networks of software developers that collaborate via Git.

The **formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py** executable:  
- Formats and visualizes a GraphML file.
- Plots the network with a circular or spring layout (default: spring).
- Colorizes nodes according to the affiliation attribute.
- Sets the size of the nodes according to centralities or all with the same size (default: centralities).
- Can filter what nodes are visualized according to the organizational affiliation of the developers (aka nodes).

The **formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py** visualization tool was developed by [Jose Apolinário Teixeira](http://users.abo.fi/jteixeir/) in 2024 to speed up the process of modeling and visualizing inter-individual networks created by ScrapLogGit2Net. It is an alternative to importing the GraphML file in network analysis visualization software such as Tulip, Gephi, or Visone. It speeds up the process of obtaining fast network visualizations, bypassing in certain cases the need for specialized network visualization tools.

# Problem statement

Slow to figure out (i.e., visualize) who works with whom in complex software projects.

# Vision

A world where software co-production analytics put social network visualizations at the side of standard quantitative statistical data in a very fast way.

# **formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py** Inputs

A GraphML file created with ScrapLogGit2Net or another tool. Note that the network needs to be in a specific format that models developers as nodes and associates them with organizations using node attributes.

# **formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py** Outputs

A social network visualization that captures who codes with whom in a repository (note that developers can be affiliated with firms via an affiliation attribute). The script plots the network using Python NetworkX and Python Matplotlib, and it can then be exported to several formats such as PDF and PNG.

# How **formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py** works

It simply reads the GraphML file and plots it according to the list of parameters passed via the shell.

With the parameters, you can choose:
- To either have a legend that depicts the organizational affiliation of developers or not have a legend at all.
- To position where the legend is placed or export it to a separate file.
- Filter for developers affiliated with a set of specific firms.
- Filter for developers not affiliated with a set of specific firms.
- Filter for the developers affiliated with the firms with the most developers in the networks.
- Filter for specific firms and their close collaboration partners (i.e., neighboring nodes only) leaving all others out.
- How nodes (i.e., developers) are colored.
- How nodes (i.e., developers) are sized.
- What organizations/affiliations should be displayed in the legend.

# How to use **formatFilterAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py**

You need basic skills on how to invoke Python scripts in the shell/terminal.  
Test case scripts are implemented in bash. Knowing the basics of Linux/Unix will help a lot. You do not need to be a programmer to use ScrapLogGit2Net and especially the formatAndViz-nofi-GraphML visualizer, but if you are one, and find it useful, please contribute to the project.

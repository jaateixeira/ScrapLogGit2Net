## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
   To fork the ScrapLogGit2Net repository on GitHub, go to [https://github.com/jaateixeira/ScrapLogGit2Net/](https://github.com/jaateixeira/ScrapLogGit2Net/). In the top right corner of the page, you will see a "Fork" button. Click on this button, and GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. This forked repository is now independent of the original repository, allowing you to freely make changes without affecting the original project. You can then clone your forked repository to your local machine, make your changes, and push them back to your fork on GitHub.

2. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaateixeira/ScrapLogGit2Net.git
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**
   See dependencies.sh

## Coding Style

We adopt the PEP 8 style guide towards writing clean, readable Python code.

ScrapLogGit2Net started as a quick script for scientific research. Quickly obtaining and processing data for research papers was the main goal. This is not a large, clean, object-oriented, test-driven masterpiece.
Still, good principles for Python programming apply: (1) Follow naming conventions, (2) type-check your function parameters, and be careful with the use of global variables. Variables should have descriptive names in snake_case for readability and consistency. Type hints should be used in function definitions to specify expected input and output types, enhancing code clarity and facilitating debugging. Accessing global variables should be minimized, as it can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. Instead, use function parameters and return values to manage data flow whenever possible, promoting modularity and reducing side effects.

### PEP 8 Coding Style Guide

PEP 8 is the style guide for Python code. It promotes readability and consistency in Python codebases. Following these guidelines will help improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

For the full PEP 8 documentation, please visit the official page: [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

#### Using flake8 for PEP 8 Compliance

`flake8` is a tool that checks your Python code against the PEP 8 style guide. It helps identify and fix stylistic issues in your code.

#### Setting Up flake8

To install `flake8`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flake8
```

#### To check your Python files for PEP 8 compliance, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
flake8 your_module.py
```

### Allowed Global Variables

The following global variables exist:

Please use the built-in `globals()` function to access the global scopeâ€™s name table. This signals developers that we are dealing with an important global variable that we should not mess up with.

| File                              | Variable                        | Type                | Description                                           |

## Project Architecture

The ScrapLogGit2Net project leverages several powerful Python libraries to achieve its functionality. This section provides an overview of the key libraries used and how they fit into the project's architecture.

![ScrapLogGit2Net Architecture Diagram](./ScrapLogGit2Net_architecture.svg)

### NumPy

**NumPy** is used for numerical operations, including the creation and manipulation of arrays and matrices. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

- **Usage**: NumPy is typically used for data manipulation, mathematical calculations, and handling large datasets.
- **Documentation**: [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

### NetworkX

**NetworkX** is utilized for creating, manipulating, and studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It allows for the creation of both undirected and directed graphs, along with various algorithms to analyze them.

- **Usage**: NetworkX is used for constructing and analyzing network graphs, which is a core part of the project's functionality.
- **Documentation**: [NetworkX Documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/)

### Matplotlib

**Matplotlib** is a plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It is heavily used for generating plots, charts, and other graphical representations of data.

- **Usage**: Matplotlib is used to visualize data, such as network graphs and other statistical plots.
- **Documentation**: [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)

### Argparse

### Rich

**Rich** is a library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal. It is used to create aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly command-line interfaces with features like progress bars, tables, and syntax highlighting.

- **Usage**: Rich is used to enhance the terminal output, making it more informative and visually appealing, especially for progress indicators and formatted output.
- **Documentation**: [Rich Documentation](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Rich is used for:
- Printing colored text in the console (e.g., debug information)
- Printing text in Markdown format for better readability
- Printing emojis that reflect the state or mood in the console
- Inspect function to help you learn about objects
- Colored Logging in integration with Loguru

- **Documentation**: [Loguru Documentation](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### Integration and Workflow

The integration of these libraries follows a well-structured workflow:
1. **Data Handling**: NumPy is used to preprocess and handle data efficiently.
2. **Network Construction**: NetworkX is used to construct and manipulate network graphs from the data.
3. **Visualization**: Matplotlib is used to create visual representations of the network graphs and other data.
4. **User Interface**: Rich is used to create an enhanced command-line interface for better user interaction.
5. **Logging**: Loguru is used throughout the project to log important information, errors, and debugging details.

By leveraging these libraries, ScrapLogGit2Net achieves a robust, efficient, and user-friendly architecture that simplifies complex data operations, network analysis, visualization, and interaction.

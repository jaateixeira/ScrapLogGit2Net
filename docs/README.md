# ScrapLogGit2Net
Tools supporting the mining of Git repositories. It creates social networks based on common source-code file edits. 

The tool was first developed by Jose Apolinário Teixeira during his doctoral studies with some guidance from  Software Engineering scholars with expertise in the mining of software repositories. 

Newer features allow you to: 
- Filter developers by email (handy to deal with bots that commit code)
- Support for parallel edges (.e., multiple edges between two nodes) that allow attributing weight to a cooperative relationship between two developers (e.g., the number of times they co-edited a source code file).
- Visualize collaborations dynamically using  [NetworkX is a Python package](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/) and [Matplotlib: Visualization with Python](https://matplotlib.org/). 

The code was also recently made compliant with the [NetworkX is a Python package](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/) data structures and the [python 3.10 version](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/) runtime which simplified the original code base.

# Problem statement # 
Hard to figure out who works with whom in complex software projects. 

# Vision
A world where software co-production analytics put social network visualizations at the side of standard quantitative statistical data.  All towards the improved management and engineering of complex software projects orchestrated on Git. 

# Inputs #

A git repository and its commit logs.


# Outputs #
Social networks that capture who codes who who in a repository (note that a software project can have multiple repositories).

# How it works #

It uses the commit logs of a git repository
```git log --pretty=format:"==%an;%ae;%ad=="  --name-only```

- %an stands for author name
- %ae stands for author email
- %ad stands for author date

Then: 
- It starts by identifying what source-code files were changed by whom at a given point in time. 
- Then associate each file with the developers that co-edited the same source-code file. 
- Then connects developers in a network. Nodes are software developers with a unique email. Edges are established if developers co-edited the same source-code file (i.e., nodes connect by working on the same files). 

Note that:
- Some manual developer's email aggregation might be required as the same developers can use multiple emails.
- Software bots can also commit code, undermining your analysis of human-to-human collaboration. 
- Co-editing some files might not be an indicator of collaboration. It's like some scholars co-authoring articles where little or no cooperation existed as expected.  For example, when  analysing projects in the C programming language, the co-editing of a Makefile might not be an indicator of collaboration, but instead an indicator of coordination. 

  
# How to use it  #

You need basic skills of Git and basic skills on how to invoke python scripts (test case scripts are implemented in bash).  Knowing python code will also help a lot. 
You do not need to be a programmer to use ScrapLogGit2Net, but if you are one, and find it usefull, please contribute to the project. 

## First, clone a Git repository 

Clone the Git repository you wish to mine with Social Network Analysis. Here is the example for TensorFlow: 

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
```


## Second, get the Git logs for scraping 


Obtain the commit logs that will be the main input for ScrapLogGit2Net. In this example, they are saved to the tensorFlowGitLog.IN file. 
Note that data scraping is a technique where a computer program extracts data from human-readable output coming from another program. In this case ScrapLogGit2Net will extract data coming from git.

```
git log --pretty=format:"==%an;%ae;%ad=="  --name-only > tensorFlowGitLog.IN
```

If you are lost by this point, time to learn about Git. 

```
man git
man git log
```

Congratulations you should have your raw data ready for analysis with ScrapLogGit2Net


Look at you INPUT data.  As you can see from the following 4 April 2024 sample data from TensorFlow, you get time.stamped data on who changed what files. 
Note that gardner@tensorflow.org is a bot. Not a developer that directly commits code.

What ScrapLogGit2Net does is to parse this time-stamps and associate developers that co-edited the same source-code file in a social network.  If two developers co-edit the same source-code file over time, we can assume that they cooperate with each other. A bit like scietists that co-author papers.  



Note the example year covers almost 10 years of commit logs in the TensorFlow project. It might be wise to narrow down the time window you want to analyse.


```git log --pretty=format:"==%an;%ae;%ad=="  --name-only```

In the following example you are checking commit logs between 1st and 4th of April 2021 

```git log --since='Apr 1 2021' --until='Apr 4 2021' --pretty=format:"==%an;%ae;%ad=="  --name-only```

And this example you check what developers did on 1st of April 2024


```git log --since='Mar 31 2024' --until='Apr 1 2024' --pretty=format:"==%an;%ae;%ad=="  --name-only```

Finally, the last example foes to the tensor flow reposiutory and gets the data to study the  first trimester for 2024

```cd tensorflow && git log --since='Jan 1 2024' --until='Mar 31 2024' --pretty=format:"==%an;%ae;%ad=="  --name-only > tensorFlowGitLog-first-trimester-2024.IN ```


- Now lets analyse some data.

## Scrap the data - Get basic statistics and social networks 
```
./scrapLog.py  --raw  test-data/tensorFlowGitLog-first-trimester-2024.IN
```
or
```
`python3 scrapLog.py  -r test-data/tensorFlowGitLog-first-trimester-2024.IN
```

By default, and all goes well, you get a "NetworkFile.graphML" file prefixed with the data input filename (e.g., tensorFlowGitLog-first-trimester-2024.IN.NetworkFile.graphMK) capturing the social network. 
Congrats. You collected social network data ready for analysis. 


# Known issues on mining Git respositories from a network perspective with ScrapLogGit2Net 

ScrapLogGit2Net shines at mining Git repositories with Social Network Analysis because it takes a multi-level perspective. It tries to capture and model collaboration in terms of source-code file co-editing in terms of both individuals and organizations. It does that by trying to assign an organization attribute to each developer. An organization should be a firm, research institute, university, etc).  However, it does it by looking at the email that developers set when pulling code contributions to the repository. 

* If john pulls the code with jonn@us.ibm.comm, john gets attributed with ibm. 
* If Silvia pulls the code with Silvia@amazon.com, Silvia gets attributed amazon.com
* If Gregor pulls with gregor@gmail.com, Gregor gets associated with gmail.  

The approach works well, most of the time. But there are known issues that should be mitigated. Often by hard work, where data needs to be "cleaned" manually or using semi-automated approaches whenever possible. 

## Getting with firm atributes from emails 


If a developer has two or more organization emails (e.g., works part-time for two organizations). Should it be treated as two developers !!  Or merged into one. This might require additional investigation on the developer and its contributions to figure out the best way to model the social network. 
If a developer changes organization (e.g. changed email), by default ScrapLogGit2Net models him as another developer. You might want to model it in another way. 
If a developer contributes with a personal email account (Gmail, Outlook) and with a firm account (e.g., ibm, amazon) during the same period, what should be done? ScrapLogGit2Net associates the developer with gmail. But it might make sense to associate him with the firm he also commits. Should contributions submitted with personal use email services (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook) be considered as personal contributions that have nothing to do with an organization the developer works with? 

When associating emails with developers, and developers with firms, it is a good approach to find suspicious similarities on the strings identifying actors in the network. The Python package [strsimpy](https://pypi.org/project/strsimpy/) implements many algorithms for string similarity. The names 'George Tony' and 'George Toony'  have a very high string similarity score, so they are probably the same person.  Test for similarity in names and emails to enhance the robustness of the social network model. 

### A developer can have several emails!   ### 

There are many ways to deal with developers that use several emails. The simplest one is to use the aproach by [Augustina Ragwitz (2017)](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/316662_7181d6efdd584358b935f7e444efb152.html), the 
first email address found in the commit log for an author is then the authoritative one. According to her: 
  > While other methods should be explored and compared for better accuracy, this is sufficient to identify unique authors.

If the Git repository is hosted in GitHub.  You can dig and solve this issue with more confidence by assessing the developer's profiles with your favourite programming language using the GitHub GraphQL API  (see  [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql))  or the GitHub  REST API (see [https://docs.github.com/en/rest](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)).  For that, you will need the necessary permission with a GitHub account and an authentication token.  For Python lovers, PyGithub  is readily available  with methods that interface with the GitHub REST API
(see [https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html)). 

Note, however, that GitHub GraphQL API was designed in a way that you can retrieve relational graph-oriented data more efficiently from large social networks. 

If the Git repository is not hosted in GitHub, you can use the approach by [Teixeira, Leppänen and Hyrynsalmi (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09329) that used pattern-matching techniques with regular expressions to identify unique names and emails.  Note that in their study of code reviews on the Linux Kernel,  adopted a strictly extrarelational approach: individuals are identified by their real names, while all affiliations are based on explicit data extraction from the domain names in individuals’ e-mail addresses. ScrapLogGit2Net get developers' ids and their affiliations from e-mail addresses, simply ignoring their names. 



### A developer can hide his email!   ### 

Most developers do not hide their email from the git logs. Like scientists in their articles, they want to keep their names as authors or contributors. However, they can remain anonymous or simply do not want to be contacted or avoid spam. This is popular since GitHub started allowing the association of pseudo email addresses on the format [8 digit number]+[username]@users.noreply.github.com that are still associated with their GitHub profile. For example, a git commit from Ruslan Inovic <rroinov@gmail.com> might appear as <608192+rosmanov@users.noreply.github.com>. See GitHub documentation on the issue at [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#about-commit-email-addresses). Once again using the GitHub GraphQL API  (see  [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql))  or the GitHub  REST API (see [https://docs.github.com/en/rest](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)) would allow to map the @users.noreply.github.com with developers or other emails used by them. Note that once a developer commits code with an email, it will always be associated with him on GitHub, when a developer sets commits to be signed with my no-reply email, he is only affecting the future commits, not the past recorded ones. 

## Some collaborative edges are missed with logitudinal segmentation!

As pointed out by [Teixeira et al. (2015)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13174-015-0028-2), when studying code-collaboration as a synchronous behaviour happening across different time windows (release after release or year after year), you will miss some collaboration edges between two developers who contributed to the same file that started before the time-window opened for analysis, or did not end before the time-window closes. See [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13174-015-0028-2/figures/3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13174-015-0028-2/figures/3). 

A way to quantify this issue is to first analyze all the historical data. From day 0 to the last day save the edges. Then conduct the analysis in segments (e.g., year after year, release after release, etc). Then see how many edges there are in the network from all the time that were not captured by the time-limited analysis. 0 is ideal. But expect a few.  Given that people tend to drop coding efforts before Xmas and New Year, or before releasing a new version (they as mostly stabilizing over developoing new features), the impacts on the model validity are very small. 


# Command line options for advanced use

- Use serialized changelogs so you don't need to use raw git logs every time (speeds things up)
- Provide a configuration file with emails (aka developers) that should be ignored. Handy for ignoring bots that commit code
- Use verbose mode for debuging and testing 

```
usage: scrapLog.py [-h] [-l LSER] [-r RAW] [-s SSER] [-fe FILTER_EMAILS] [-ff FILTER_FILES] [-v]

Scrap some chagelog to create networks/graphs for research purpses

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LSER, --lser LSER  loads and processes an serialized changelog
  -r RAW, --raw RAW     processes from a raw git changelog
  -s SSER, --sser SSER  processses from a raw git changelog and saves it into a serialized changelog. Requires -r for imput
  -fe FILTER_EMAILS, --filter_emails FILTER_EMAILS
                        ignores the emails listed in a text file (one email per line)
  -ff FILTER_FILES, --filter_files FILTER_FILES
                        ignores the files listed in a text file (one file per line)
  -v, --verbose         increased output verbosity
```

For example, the following command 

```./scrapLog.py -f test-configurations/TensorFlowBots.txt  -r test-data/tensorFlowGitLog-all-till-12-Apri-2024.IN --verbose`` 

scraps the Git log in the test-data/tensorFlowGitLog-all-till-12-Apri-2024.IN input file, ignores emails listed in the test-configurations/TensorFlowBots.txt file and prints debug information in a verbose way. By default it also creates a
network file in the standard XML based format GraphML. 


# Features 

## Recently implemented features 
- Export to the [GraphML][http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/] format for graphs based on XML. Exports undirected grapths with company affiliation atributes. 
- Optional verbose debug output.
- Use of a serialized changelog, so we dont't need to use RAW git logs every time. Save a lot of time for analysing complext projects.
- Possibiliry of adding an argument pointing with a file with emails to ignore (e.g., bots and spam email addresses).
- Dynamic export of social network visualizations with in the circular and centrality layouts.
- Dynamic node size based on degree centrality in the circular and centrality layouts. High connected nodes are bigger, less connected nodes are smaller.
- Transformation of unweighted inter-individual networks into weighted inter-organizational networks. The weight is equal to the number of inter-organizational relationships. Intra-organizational relationships are ignored. 

## To implement (voluntears welcome)
- Account for co-authorships made explicit with the 'Co-authored-by:' string on the  trailer tof the commit's message [see documentation on https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors). Opens the way for triangulation.
- Account for commits on behalf of organizations using the 'on-behalf-of: @ORG NAME[AT]ORGANIZATION.COM' string on the trailer of the commit's message [see documentation on https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-on-behalf-of-an-organization).
- Possibility to add an argument pointing to a file with REGULAR EXPRESSIONS to capture emails to ignore (e.g., ignoring developers from a given company).
- Possibility to add an argument pointing with a file that aggregates different emails used by a different individual  (e.g., John uses <John@ibm.com> and <John@gmail.com>).
- Possibility to add an argument pointing with a file that aggregates different emails used by different organizations (e.g., @ibm.com, @linux.vnet.ibm.com, @us.ibm.com, @cn.ibm.com all map IBM).
- Possibility to export both networks at the individual and organizational level (networks of individuals affiliated with organizations, and networks of organizations) during scraplog execution from git log data.
- Possibility to limit analysis to n top contributors (organization with most nodes).
- Colorize nodes by company affiliation automatically.
- Report stats on the files connecting people the most (handy for identifying outliers). 
- Support for weighted edges.
- Reporting analysis in latex, Markdown, HTML and text files. Should include quantitative metrics (e.g., n. commits, n. lines of code per dev, most co-edited files) and relational metrics (e.g., centrality, density). 
- Support for other network formats besides graphML (see [https://socnetv.org/docs/formats.html](https://socnetv.org/docs/formats.html)).
- Support for community detection.
- Use a logging system (e.g., [https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) or [https://github.com/gruns/icecream](https://github.com/gruns/icecream)) instead of print statements for debugging.
- Write unit tests for the main functions in scrapLogGit2Net (see [https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)).
- Use config files as there are already so many parameters.
- Integrate with the [TNM Tool for Mining of Socio-Technical Data from Git Repositories](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tnm). Cool, advanced, research-based but in coded in java. See [TNM tool presentation at MSR (2021) conference])[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NXaY8zTEOU]. 
- Integrate with the [git2net tool that also that facilitates the extraction of co-editing networks from git repositories.](https://github.com/gotec/git2net). Cool, advanced, research-based and also coded in python. Have a more sofisticated aproach to edges based on entrophy and offers desambiguation features. 
- Publish as a python package to the community.
